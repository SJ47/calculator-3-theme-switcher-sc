## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
-   Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
-   Adjust the color theme based on their preference
-   **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

-   HTML5 markup
-   CSS
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

-   More exposure to styled components in React
-   Additional learning using Grid
-   How to implement a theme switch component for more than two themes
-   Saving data locally based on theme preferences
-   Implementing `prefers-color-scheme` to match users system preferences if no locally saved theme found
-   Breaking down functions into single areas of responsibilities

### Continued development

I plan to continue getting more familiar and experience with Styled Components along with Grid. I also need to refactor a number of areas.
